## Description
This Responsive landing page was developed for @llanosecolodge, with the aim of being a presentation web page of a Glamping accommodation service in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. In this way, they attract more customers on the internet, not only through social networks. With this website, you have a clear vision of the accommodation proposal, knowing all its characteristics and amenities.

## Details
After learning how to manipulate the web DOM well, thanks to TheAppBrewery for the Udemy course, I set out to create this game. The game consists of the user having to press the buttons, in the correct order shown on the screen.

I created the game in August 2021. It has infinite levels and patterns, totally random, for the user to have fun. I did this by creating Random values with JavaScript. Try to beat my record!
