## Description
This Responsive landing page was developed for @llanosecolodge, with the aim of being a presentation web page of a Glamping accommodation service in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. In this way, they attract more customers on the internet, not only through social networks. With this website, you have a clear vision of the accommodation proposal, knowing all its characteristics and amenities.
<br><br>
To increase the trust of your followers and potential clients, it is highly recommended to have a website that gathers general information about the service they offer, so that the client fully understands what it is, and how to hire it.
<br><br>
The project took me a little less than a month of work, but it was a very satisfying experience, since it allowed me to learn a lot about how to use certain libraries that I had never seen before, and it helped me to understand how to build a site with a great variety of technologies.
<br><br>
I also did a redesign of their logo, being much more minimalist. The page was designed and developed by me, between June and August 2021.
